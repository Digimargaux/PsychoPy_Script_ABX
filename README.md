# PsychoPy_Script_ABX
Here is a PsychoPy script I created to create an audio ABX discrimination task ! If by any chance someone wants to use it please feel free to do so ! It has issues since I have very little knowledge in the  matter but I really had a good time crying over it for hours. Thank you Nicolas for helping me out with the basics since I know you will be reading this.
